#This programs calculates the first 10 fibonacci numbers
#Data representation will be given in n-1s representation: ex 111 = 3, 11111=5
#The tape has to be initialized with the value 1M1L0
#The response will be given by <n result>M<n-1 result>L<n-2 result>
#The vocabulary of the program is:
# - 1 = unary count for representation
# - M = Begining of n-1 result
# - L = Begining of n-2 result
# - Y = Position last read (internal use)
# - X = Position masked as deleted (internal use)

# S-0: Find the beginning of n-2 (L)
0,1,0,1,R # If 1 found, move to the right
0,M,0,M,R # If M found, move to the right
0,Y,0,Y,R # If X found, move to the right
0,X,0,X,R # If Y found, move to the right
0,_,0,_,R # If _ found, move to the right
0,L,0,L,R # If L found, move to the right and go to state 1

# S-1: Find 1's to copy from result n-2 to result n 
1,1,3,Y,L # If 1 found, mark as read Y and go to S-3 (write 1 to N)
1,Y,1,X,R # If Y found, mark as deleted and move right
1,_,1,_,L # If _ found, you have completed copying. n-2. Now copy n-1, state 2

# S-2: Find 1's to copy from result n-1 to result n 
2,1,4,Y,L # If 1 found, mark as read Y and go to S-4 (write 1 to N)
2,Y,2,X,R # If Y found, mark as deleted and move right
2,L,1,L,P # If _ found, you have completed copying. n-1. NOW?????

# S-3: Write 1's from result n-2 to result n 
3,1,3,1,L # Find left edge of tape
3,M,3,M,L # Find left edge of tape
3,L,3,L,L # Find left edge of tape
3,Y,3,Y,L # Find left edge of tape
3,X,3,X,L # Find left edge of tape
3,_,1,1,P # If _ found, write the 1, go back to S-1

# S-4: Write 1's from result n-1 to result n 
4,1,4,1,L # Find left edge of tape
4,M,4,M,L # Find left edge of tape
4,L,4,L,L # Find left edge of tape
4,Y,4,Y,L # Find left edge of tape
